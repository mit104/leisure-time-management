        <h2>Problem and Design Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The problem we are addressing is the lack of tools to effectively manage leisure time. Many people struggle 
            to balance their work and personal lives, often forgetting to allocate time for relaxation and fun activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution is an application that helps users plan and track their leisure activities, providing reminders 
            and reports on how they spend their time.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Research Process and Key Insights</h2>
        <p>
            During our research process, we conducted surveys and interviews with potential users to understand their 
            pain points. Our key insights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users need reminders to take breaks and engage in leisure activities.</li>
            <li>Many people have difficulty tracking how much time they spend on non-work activities.</li>
            <li>An easy-to-use interface is crucial for encouraging users to adopt the tool.</li>
        </ul>
